Hello! I'm Riccardo Bellanca 🎯
---------------------------------

### Junior Software Engineer & M.S. in Computer Engineering

I am a Master's student in **Computer Engineering** at Politecnico di Torino, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics**.

I am fascinated by the idea of building software that is scalable, efficient, and capable of having a tangible impact on the real world. What drives me is the desire to learn: I am passionate about discovering new technologies, diving into complex problems, and, above all, working with people more experienced than me to absorb knowledge, challenge myself, and raise my standards every day.

I am ambitious, with a strong interest in backend and full-stack development. More than any specific stack, I care about building products that are solid, meaningful, and well-crafted. I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills in practical and dynamic contexts, ready to give my all to grow and contribute to a team that shares the same drive.
